# Reflection on Week 08 #

This week, I think I did pretty well - the best I've done in a while. This is not necessarily because I thought my code was amazing, but moreso having to do with time management. As I am moving to a new home and with a couple major family events happening - I am pretty proud of myself for being able to keep up as normally I would have fallen behind. 

In terms of my code, I think that I did pretty well. My code compiles, passes all the tests, and it structured similarly to the code in the solution (barring some stylistic choices). However, there is one difference that I wanted to discuss. In my code, I explicitly calculated the expected position of the node in question. However, the solution has a helper method `hashPosition` that calculates it outside of the method. Although this is a stylistic choice, this definitely would have helped the readability of the code. 

One other thing - I added a method (or two) that wasn't used in the code, but was kept there as I thought it may have been useful in other contexts outside of the scope of this assignemnt. However, I recognize that it is also a somewhat unneeded piece of code, especially under what was asked of me. So this week, I finished just exactly what was asked of me.
